#Request::DynamicParser error handling:
    throw custom exceptions and imediately return HTTP::Response::make_error_response in ServerCluster + close the client

#max client body size

#Clean and universal way to upload files

#fcntl ?

#CGI env variables

#If no content_length is returned from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data

#Our CGis probably sucks

#Test in python ?

#Send error on timeout (408)
